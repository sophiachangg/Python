The first window you see is the main menu. To use the functionality of the program, simply go to the Questions menu
in the top left corner and choose the option you wish to use. The questions are already loaded into the listbox
to make things easier. The View selection in the Questions menu will display the questions again if needed. For example,
if you use the Search function and would like to see the list of question again, simply navigate back to the Questions
menu and select View.

The second function in the menu is the Add function. This allows you to add a question to the existing list of ten.
Once you click on the Add function, the entries will be enabled for you to type in the question, points, choices and so
on. Once you are done entering the details, press the Save Question button to add the question to the quiz game.

The third function is the Edit function. When you select this function, instructions will appear above the listbox
telling you how to edit a question. Once you are done editing the detail, click the Save Question button to save the
edited question.

The Delete function allows you to double click on a question to delete it.

The last selection in the Question menu is the Search function. To search for a question, type the question you want
to find in the first textbox and press the Search button. If your question matches one in the system, it will be
displayed in the bottom listbox.

To take the quiz game, simply press the Take Quiz button. All entries have been disabled so the user can not alter the
question and its details. The one entry that is available is the Your Answer entry where you will type in the answer
you think is correct. Do not type Choice 1, 2, 3, or 4. Type in the actual answer and click the Submit button to check
if your answer is correct. If your answer was correct, the Correct Feedback will be displayed. If your answer was
incorrect, the Incorrect Feedback will be displayed. Whether the answer was correct or not, the Points Earned, Number
of Correct Questions, and the Question Count will be shown at the bottom. Once you want to move on to the next question,
click the Next Question button and it will display the new question for you to answer. Once you finished your 3
questions, the game is over. If you try click the Next Question button, it will not show you another question. You can
view your score at the bottom of the application.
